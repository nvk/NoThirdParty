Coinkite is a Canadian Bitcoin company, known for its multisignature wallet.

## Security

Coinkite offers two kinds of wallets: a “Simple Wallet” where CK signs the transactions and holds the private keys, and multisig vaults.

The “Simple Wallet” is a BIP32 HD wallet where Coinkite holds the private keys. You are not able to access the private keys and must trust Coinkite to secure the keys. The “Simple Wallet” should not be used to store large amounts of bitcoin. With full control over all “Simple Wallet” accounts and private keys, Coinkite can shut down your account and block access to your funds at anytime.

Coinkite’s multsig wallets allow up 15 co-signers, which can be: signed by CK, an encrypted wallet stored on CK, a new key generated by CK, another CK user, the Ledger hardware wallet, or a BIP32 key. Coinkite’s multisig wallets give you 100% control of private keys.

Users must trust Coinkite to provide the correct transaction data.

## Privacy

Coinkite requires an email address on signup. Your email address, name, and any other personal information could be connected to your addresses and balance.

The “quick deposit” feature reuses the same address. Address reuse makes it easy for others to observe your history on the blockchain and connect your addresses and funds.

Coinkite allows you to access their wallet with a TOR onion address: http://gcvqzacplu4veul4.onion
