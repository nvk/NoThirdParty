Circle is a digital money company focused on making money "instant, secure, and free". Its homepage only briefly mentions Bitcoin, and its wallet doesn't do much more than receiving and spending.

Accounts may be accessed on Circle's website and iPhone or Android app. Both apps allow the buying and selling of bitcoin and basic sending and receiving of payments.

Circle allows its customers to hold funds denominated in bitcoin or USD. Funds held as dollars are still be spent and received through the Bitcoin network.

## Security

As a web/hot wallet, Circle should not be used to store large amounts of bitcoin. With full control over all accounts and private keys, your funds may be frozen at any time.

Although all bitcoin held is insured, a loss is only covered if something goes wrong on Circle's end. Your bitcoin is gone if your account is hacked.

Two-factor authentication is required.

## Privacy

Your name, phone number, email, and a number of other personal details are required. You must trust Circle's servers to verify transaction data. Circle knows your addresses and balances at all times and can connect this with your identity. Because of buy/sell features, it must also follow all KYC laws.

Each payment request uses a new address, which helps prevent other users from connecting Bitcoin addresses together.
